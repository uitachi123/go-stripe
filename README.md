# go-stripe
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a great start up focusing on building `payment infrastructure` for the Internet. To understand what they can offer better, this is a toy app to demonstrate some features of stripe APIs. Of course what `Stripe` can provide is way more than what are demonstrated here but hopefully this app could give you a sense about there business ambitions.

# stripe API features to demostrate
- [x] stripe product creation/deletion
- [x] credit card payments (UI + validation callback)
